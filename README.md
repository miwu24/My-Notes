# My-Notes
This folder includes miscellaneous notes I prepared, compiled, or took when I hosted/attended seminars, took classes, or read books. Some only include coursework/homework of the course without notes.<br>
Topics included are quite broad: Machine Learning, Theoretical Machine Learning, Theoretical Statistics, 
Nonlinear Dimension Reduction (Manifold Learning), TDA (Topological Data Analysis), just to name a few. <br>
